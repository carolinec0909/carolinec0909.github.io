Hey, I’m **Caroline**, a machine learning engineer focused on recommender systems.  
I think a lot about how models connect people to the things they love (and how small tweaks can change what millions see).

This blog is my space to slow down, reflect, and write about what I’m learning, what’s confusing, and what I find beautiful in ML and beyond.  
Some posts might be technical deep dives, others might just be thoughts on design, intuition, or how *human* the work behind “machine learning” actually is.

### What You'll Find Here
- Notes on recommender systems, ranking, and personalization  
- Random experiments and ML rabbit holes  
- Thoughts on *why* we build, not just *how*  

### Why I Write
I started this as a personal notebook to **make sense of ideas by writing them out**.  
It’s part reflection, part exploration, and hopefully something useful for anyone walking a similar path.
